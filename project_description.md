# Content: Supervised Learning
## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
Proposal for the project is based on Toxic Comments featured in feeds, tweets and comments on
various social pages. Natural Language Processing and Recurring Neural Network are one of the most
powerful domains of Machine Learning and are linked in many ways. Recently, it has been observed a
decline in people expressing themselves due to continuous threat of abuse and harassment they face
online. Seeking opinions and raising their voices over any discussion are becoming difficult day by day
due to toxic comments. People are getting bullied with the toxic remarks. Existing platforms struggle to
effectively facilitate conversations. If we can solve the problem for toxic comments using Machine
Learning techniques it will be easy for people to express themselves without any reluctance. More
opinions will lead to more ideas and more developments. Recently, many companies worked on similar
projects and provided APIs like Perspective API from Google etc. But current models still make errors
and they are not of much help. An attempt will be made on Wikipedia comment's data using Machine
Learning Techniques . Personally, motivation behind the project is to let public speak and come out on
major issues. More number of people will open up so we get to know real life issues and that's how
other problems can also be dealt very easily.

## Project Highlights
Toxic Comment Classification is the major goal for this project. I will use Deep Learning and Neural
Networks to train the model and help to detect accurateness of toxic comments detection. At start I will
start working with basic models to check if we are getting correct output then will tune the model in
more elaborate manner with deep learning. This Problem is frequent nowadays and can be easily
worked upon as it is quantifiable.

## Software Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 3.5.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-355/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

## Starting the Project

You are provided with a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:

toxic
severe_toxic
obscene
threat
insult
identity_hate
You must create a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.

File descriptions
train.csv - the training set, contains comments with their binary labels
test.csv - the test set, you must predict the toxicity probabilities for these comments. To deter hand labeling, the test set contains some comments which are not included in scoring.
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
test_labels.csv - labels for the test data; value of -1 indicates it was not used for scoring; (Note: file added after competition close!)

## Submitting the Project

### Evaluation
Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the **<a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/406/view" target="_blank">Finding Donors for CharityML project rubric</a>**. Be sure to review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must be *meeting specifications* for you to pass.

### Submission Files


Once you have collected these files and reviewed the project rubric, proceed to the project submission page.

### I'm Ready!
When you're ready to submit your project, click on the **Submit Project** button at the bottom of the page.

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at **machine-support@udacity.com** or visit us in the <a href="http://discussions.udacity.com" target="_blank">discussion forums</a>.

### What's Next?
You will get an email as soon as your reviewer has feedback for you. In the meantime, review your next project and feel free to get started on it or the courses supporting it!
